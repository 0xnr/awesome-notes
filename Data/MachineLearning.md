1. Supervised learning (we teach the computer how to learn)
1.1 Regression: Predict a continuous valued output.
Linear regression with one variable aka. Univariate linear regression.
Goal is to minimize cost function -> Gradient descent (optimize local minimum)

1.2 Classification: Discrede valued output (0 or 1).

2. Unsupervised learning (the computer learns itself)
Clustering: Clustering news or market segments

3. Reinforcement learning

4. Recommender systems
