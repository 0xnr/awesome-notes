## Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised learning (we teach the computer how to learn)
  Regression: Predict a continuous valued output.
  Linear regression with one variable aka. Univariate linear regression.
    Goal is to minimize cost function -> Gradient descent (optimize local minimum)

  Classification: Discrede valued output (0 or 1).

2. Unsupervised learning (the computer learns itself)
  Clustering: Clustering news or market segments

3. Reinforcement learning

4. Recommender systems

## Features scaling

Make features fit into a rang between -1 and 1 so they converge faster

To do so divide them by the maximum possible value in the featureset

A range between -3 and 3  or -1/3 and 1/3 seems ok

## Mean normalization

Make features have approximately 0 mean
