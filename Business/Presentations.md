0. Golden Rules
Follow a process
Benefits before features
Ideas first, slides second
Each level summarizes concepts grouped below
Ideas in presentation in logical order
Groups of concept always the same kind of idea
Make use of words & graphics
Our design goal is harmony and simplicity
Composition of slide to reinforce main message
Make arguments with facts
Don't use pie-charts

1. Preparation
If you fail to prepare your preparing to fail

2. Structure
Clear logical structure
Step by step argument
Sound logic

3. Format
Consistent slide format
Slides communicate key message
Can be read in advance

4. Data
Data intensive
Assertions proven with facts
Simple, clean charts

5. Areas
Start
Power of logical structure
Art of storytelling
Harmony of design
Science of fact-based persuasion
Drama of performance

6. Process
Who (are we speaking to)
Why (are we speaking to them)
What (is our answer)
How (will we deliver)

Who
Audience is the hero and the star
Who is your audience
Who are the decision makers

Audience map: Personality, Power, Access, Resistance

Why
What does the audience know already
Identify questions of audience
Determine result that is going to happen
Create and introduction

What
Brainstorm, Visual thinking tools
Structure
Storyboard
Design

How
Practice verbally / film
Clarity, Pace, Engage with audience, eye-contact, gestures

7. Introduction (Why)
Context (background to presentation, what does audience already know)
Catalyst (what happened, changes, root cause, cause of presentation)
Question (Which question do we want to answer, why, what, how, how else)

8. Objective
The next step
Our objective is to compel our audience to do something
Focus on a singe objective
Use Action words (decide, discuss, review, select, complete)
RACI framework for complex tasks
Deadline required
Ensure next steps are clear and agreed

"Review xyz in the next 72hours to do bla"

9. Idea Generation (How)

Gather existing content
Expand and improve existing content (challenge it, make more relevant)
Create new analysis

9.1 Brainstorming

Traditional brainstorming doesn't work
It's less effective than solo creative thinking
Debate and discuss with constructive criticism is more effective

a. Brainstorm alone
b. Brainstorm as part of a group
c. brainstorm alone again

Plan participants (only invite brains, no negatives)
Structure session (have plan, keep short, get everyone wired-up)
Establish rules (prohibit electronics, one conversation at time, stay focused)
Focus on ideas (engage in dissent and debate, go for quality, encourage wild ideas)

9.2 Visual thinking

Index Cards (one idea per card)
Sticky post-it notes (variation of card, different colours, stickers)
Mind map
Hanging folders

Summary:
Create idea first
Leverage existing content
Brainstorm in groups and alone
Engage in Debate and Dissent
Brainstorming rules
Use visual thinking tools

10. Structure

Hierarchy will levels of abstractions (3-levels)

10.1 Each level summarizes concepts grouped below

Example:
1. Bank can cut costs by 50million
1.1. streamline central functions
1.1.1 change to online training

10.2 Ideas in presentation in logical order

a. what is the right way of framing these ideas to make argument

Deductive reasoning (general hypothesis, reach logic conclusion)
Inductive reasoning (bottom-up logic, general arguments from specific examples)

b. what is the right order to introduce your ideas (importance first)

Time order (whats first)
Cause & effect (cause followed by effect)
Degree of importance (listed by order of importance)
Underlying process (sequence of steps required to accomplish something)

10.3 Groups of concept always the same kind of idea

MECE

Mutual exclusive (ME)
Each idea in the list is distinct from each of other ideas (no overlap)

Collectively exhaustive (CE)
Collectively, all ideas in the list cover all possible component (no gaps)

4-5 chunks of information and only one at a time (group in buckets)

At each level structure ideas into groups of 4-5 or less

Summary:
Group ideas into hierarchies
Order your ideas
Ideas in the groups are the same kind
Create MECE  list
Follow updated rule of 7 (buckets with 4-5, one at a time)

11. Art of storytelling

Most fundamental communication method
When telling a story, more areas of brain are stimulated than in an explanation

What is story?
Why use stories?
What are characteristics of a good story?
How do i use stories in presentations?

What is a story?
Stories are an exchange of meanings shared from one person to another.

Why use stories?
Increase trust by creating a bond between storyteller and listener
Help get the audience to agree with you (relax audience, encourage agreement)
Make message more meaningful, understandable and memorable

What are characteristics of a good story?
Simplicity (essential core of an idea)
Unexpectedness (things that surprise cut through clutter)
Concreteness (concrete language make ideas clear)
Credibility (truth will allow audience to believe our ideas)
Emotion (to care about an idea, people must feel something)

How to use stories in presentation?
Use at beginning of presentation to connect to audience.
a. Use a springboard story.
b. Use an analogy.
c. Use an image as a metaphor (activate stories from our memory)

Example to start with: Relevant quote, Image, Infographic

Use stories in the middle or at the end
a. Use stories in the middle to exemplify and give meaning to key points
b. Use a story at the end to provide one last inspiring thought before finishing

Exchange giving suggestion for telling stories
Be strategic in what stories you tell and when

Summary:
A Story i a cup (cup for your ideas)
Stories increase trust (limit disagreement and make message memorable)
Make ideas more memorable (simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional)
Use sparingly (at begging, middle or end but sparingly)

Storyboarding
Blueprint for movie
Edit before you make it

Storyboards in presentations
Presentation drawn in pictures

Why storyboarding?
a. Reveals the big picture
b. Allows story to be broken down to component
c. Improve production process
d. Reduces amount of time
e. Delays focus on design
f. Help to invent fresh ideas

Create a storyboard
a. Text based outline first (major bullet, sub-bullet)
b. Fully storyboard

Summary:
Create storyboards (more efficient, big picture)
Storyboard or outline
Use pen & paper
Ignore artistic ability (dont worry about look)
Iterate collaborate & edit

12. Harmony of design

Visual thinking is common in 60%-65% of the population

Make use of words & graphics (combination is key)

Visual attribute triggers
Form
a. Orientation
b. Shape
c. Length
d. Width
e. Size
f. Enclosure
Color
g. Hue
h. Intensity
Spatial positioning
i. 2D-position
j. Motion

Summary:
Adapt to learning styles (different ways)
Use words & visuals
Appeal to the unconscious mind (use visual attributes for pre-attentive processing)
Invest the time (effective graphics, take time to invest them)

Fundamental elements of design
Aim for Harmony & Simplicity

Our design goal is harmony and simplicity

1. Contrast (two elements on appear different)
2. Repetition (reusing of same or similar design elements)
3. Alignment (nothing is placed on a page arbitrarily)
4. Proximity (moving things closer or farther for more organisation)
5. Typography (arranging type in order to make language visible)
6. Color (2-3 colours)
7. Whitespace (use wisely to create harmony)

Gestalt principles of visual perception
1. Proximity
2. Similarity
3. Closure
4. Continuation
5. Symmetry
6. Connection

Slide Composition

Composition of slide to reinforce main message

1. Headlines (no longer than 2 lines, no smaller than 22 points, clear statement)
2. Elements, Layouts and Frameworks (stay within these boundaries)
3. Using photography and images (powerful relevant images, use judiciously)

Summary:
Headline contains main message
Body of slides content that supports message in headline
Use Frameworks (leverage common slides)
Build swipe-file
Minimalist master

13. Fact based persuasion

Make arguments with facts
Data supports main message

Graphical excellence
1. Efficient (greatest number of ideas, shortest time, with least ink)
2. Multivariate (always multivariate, involving more than one variable)
3. Honest (Requires telling the truth with data)

Three rules
1. Show the data (do not lose sights)
2. Maximize data ink (erase non data ink and redundancy)
3. Use small multiples (graphics can be shrunk way down)

Tables vs. Graphs

Tables
There is quantitative and categorical data

1. There are rows and columns
2. Information is encoded as text

Using tables criteria
a. Look-up
b. Compare
c. Present precice values
d. summary & detail

Graphs
1. Values are displayed in an area with 1 or more axes
2. Values are encoded as visual object in relation to axis
3. Axis provide scale either quantitative or categorical

Summary:
Determine how data will be used
Use tables to focus on individual values
Use graphs to show shape of the data

Graphs
Display quantitative information by giving shape (visual component to quantitative information)

Types:
Points
Bars
Lines
Boxes

Relationships:
Nominal comparison (bars)
Time series (line or bar)
Ranking (bars)
Part-to-whole (bar charts --> waterfall)
Deviation (bars, line)
Distribution (histogram, box plot)
Correlation (scatter plot)
Geospatial (map)

Don't use pie charts (hard to assign quantitative information to 2D areas)

Specialist graphs:
Bubble chart
Waterfall chart
Marimekko
Tornado chart
Motion chart

Bubble Chart is a scatterplot (easy to read, data intensive)
Waterfall chart (time element makes it rich)
Marimekko chart (all bars of equal height, capture multiple variables)
Tornado chart (communicate results of sensitivity analysis)
Motion chart (dynamic charts, use multiple variables over time)

Presentation
Develop a script (and memorize)
Focus on 4 areas (clarity, pace, eye-contact)
Check length (fit time)
Practise
Create plan b
