## Hiring

- Only hire A people
- A people will hire A people, B people will hire C people
- Find swiss army knifes no matter what their core expertise is

## Sales

- The day you decided you become entrepreneurs is the day you decided to become sales people
- Always have call to action / ask
- No touch, low touch, high touch
- Inbound, insights sales, field sales
- Best customer feedback from Sales Engineers they're very thoughtful

## Core

- Always be awesome because that forms the synapsis in your brain to always be awesome and not mediocre. Whenever you are mediocre you actually train being mediocre, thus become mediocre.
- No matter what you do, get to value as soon as possible
- Don't appoligize upfront or create any other negative energy
- Focus and zero back to the most important thing from time to time
- Unlearn previous patterns whenever you can

- Lay out assumptions up front, make sure they are defensible
- Ask upfront: "What are the key things everybody would like to learn today” and make sure you address all questions
- “I’d rather get somebody that disagrees with my thesis than giving the impression that I haven’t thought of it”
- Give people what they want or more then what they expect, dont bullshit or force contracts
- https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/building-products-91aa93bea4bb#.j0lqgopje
- Always be positive, never get defensive. You don't have to be right but do the right thing.

## Politics

- Different Buyer vs. Chooser vs. Implement vs. Users vs. End User to much political overhead

## Customers

- Don't give customers homework or make them learn something it has to be as simple as possible
- Who is the customer?
- Who shouldn't be the customer?
- When working with people identify what moves the needle for them?
  - Whats your goal for this year?
  - What problem are you trying to solve?
  - Why do you want to that? (Ask about the why five times)

## Opportunity Validation (Margin Matrix)

| |Volume|Touch|Margin|
|---|----|-----|------|
|High|X||X|
|Medium||||
|Low||X||

V for Victory is ideal!

- Don't charge monthly, charge quarterly its less accounting overhead
- No contract monthly basis

## Story

- Make it stupid simple for all linear thinkers
- Show me the shiny egg in the box that is going to change the game
- Always drive flywhell

## Reasons for Failure

- Pain not severe
- Costs of solving problem not high
- Give people exactly what they want, no hidden sneaky intransparent shit

## Fun

- The company is not your baby, you don't sell your baby you don't rename your baby

## Meetings

- The less meetings the better (Can this be an email?)
- No longer than 30 min meetings (energy drains otherwise)
- All meetings should have an explanatory title and a description so everyone can prepare and knows the purpose, goals, scope etc.

## Learning

- Everything has to be simple and sexy
- Can't be too core because than requirements explode and people built it themselves
- For the others where it isn't core its not important enough to buy or prioritize
- Everybody including my mom has to understand
- Don't overengineer solutions keep it stupid simple
- Optimize for ROI for customer (i.e. revenue)
- Measure impact of your solution don't just assume
- Save costs or increase revenue and target exactly what you do. If you don't want to be in the costs game but don't increase revenues in a measurable way, you lost.
- Never ever work on something with people that spread negative energy and have a negative attitude, a constructive positive mindset always wins.
- Tech is wort nothing, its toxic to prioritize technical sanity of a system higher than the customer experience.

## Future

- Think about in detail, how the world is going to look in the future. 10 - 20 - 50 years from now.
- Introducing SaaS tools for x, y and z introduces a new set of problems (Service reliability, Data sync ancross services, Changing Processes and Architecture to tools and not the other way around. Eventually Google and Amazon will provide enough conveneince for all those smaller features-as-a-service. Many tools will die for example.

Mindsets


1. Full integrity

No bullshit

Be the best

Lasse nicht zu das Kunden was machen, wenn du nicht 100% überzeugt bist

2. Only Premium pricing


You don’t sell your time or knowledge
You sell the value that you provide, thats the price
Result matters

Effort is exactly the same so do premium only


1. The process for everything


1. Blogpost: Stop researching already!


When my previous company got acquired and started thinking a lot whats next. One thing I had in mind for a lot was projects for complete freedom. No, not getting rich and famous but being free, which for me means.


So i started researching


The snowball effekt happened


I grew never ending lists and notes on google keep, github etc.


So I started to think about allocation of time and analysed my work using rescue time gyroscope etc.


The results where shocking.


I spend 80% of my day researching. I like researching and I believe I’m good at it. But it doesn’t create any value for anybody else but me. That has to change: 


Nonlinear thinking means which way you should go depends on where you already are.
Example: Relation between eating and health
