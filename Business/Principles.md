## Sales

- The day you decided you become entrepreneurs is the day you decided to become sales people
- Always have call to action / ask
- No touch, low touch, high touch
- Inbound, insights sales, field sales
- Best customer feedback from Sales Engineers they're very thoughtful

## Core

- Always be awesome because that forms the synapsis in your brain to always be awesome and not mediocre. Whenever you are mediocre you actually train being mediocre, thus become mediocre.
- No matter what you do, get to value as soon as possible
- Don't appoligize upfront or create any other negative energy
- Focus and zero back to the most important thing from time to time
- Unlearn previous patterns whenever you can

- Lay out assumptions up front, make sure they are defensible
- Ask upfront: "What are the key things everybody would like to learn today” and make sure you address all questions
- “I’d rather get somebody that disagrees with my thesis than giving the impression that I haven’t thought of it”
- Give people what they want or more then what they expect, dont bullshit or force contracts
- https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/building-products-91aa93bea4bb#.j0lqgopje
- Always be positive, never get defensive. You don't have to be right but do the right thing.

## Politics

- Different Buyer vs. Chooser vs. Implement vs. Users vs. End User to much political overhead

## Customers

- Don't give customers homework or make them learn something it has to be as simple as possible
- Who is the customer?
- Who shouldn't be the customer?
- When working with people identify what moves the needle for them?
  - Whats your goal for this year?
  - What problem are you trying to solve?
  - Why do you want to that? (Ask about the why five times)

## Opportunity Validation (Margin Matrix)

| |Volume|Touch|Margin|
|---|----|-----|------|
|High|X||X|
|Medium||||
|Low||X||

V for Victory is ideal!

## Pricing

- Don't charge monthly, charge quarterly its less accounting overhead
- No contract monthly basis

## Story

- Make it stupid simple for all linear thinkers
- Show me the shiny egg in the box that is going to change the game
- Always drive flywhell

## Reasons for Failure

- Pain not severe
- Costs of solving problem not high
- Give people exactly what they want, no hidden sneaky intransparent shit

## Fun

- The company is not your baby, you don't sell your baby you don't rename your baby

## Meetings

- The less meetings the better (Can this be an email?)
- No longer than 30 min meetings (energy drains otherwise)
- All meetings should have an explanatory title and a description so everyone can prepare and knows the purpose, goals, scope etc.

## Learning

- Everything has to be simple and sexy
- Can't be to core because than requirements explode and people built it themselves
- For the others where it isn't core its not important enough to buy or prioritize
- Everybody including my mom has to understand
- Don't overengineer solutions keep it stupid simple
- Optimize for ROI for customer (i.e. revenue)
- Measure impact of your solution don't just assume
- Save costs or increase revenue and target exactly what you do. If you don't want to be in the costs game but don't increase revenues in a measurable way, you lost.
