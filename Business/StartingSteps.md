## Validation techniques
1. Product-i-zation	 	
Do paid work for one person, then find a second, etc. Then build a product or	service based	on what you learned consulting.	
	
2. Home Technique	 	
Validate your idea by	working from	home before opening	a retail	outlet. Outgrow your	home before looking elsewhere.	
	
3. Craigslist Technique	 	
See if you get	any responses for	your product or service on Craigslist before building	a website,	getting business cards,	etc.	
	
4. Ghetto Email Style	 	
Don’t make anything.	 No	website, no flyers, no	anything. Just email	your friends, and	if they pay	you can move forward.	
	
5. Crappy Drawing	 	
Don’t waste time designing a pretty	mockup. Draw it out	and see if people are interested	in the idea	vs. just	a pretty design.	
	
6. Pre-Sales	 	
Get	people	to commit	money	before	you make	your product.	“I need	to sell 5 units	before	I create the product.”
