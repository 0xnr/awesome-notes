Lesson 1:

Sam Altman
build stuff and be around smart people, in best case people who are smarter than you
don't go for salary but for the things you love
only start something with what you're in love with
keep personal burn rate low

teach 30% thats applicate for building startups, 70% is hands on
goal is building a business where the goal is hypergrowth

It really is hard work like you would never imagine

The number 1 role of a CEO is managing his own psychology

Why starting a startup?
Specific passion should come first.

4 Areas
1. Idea
2. Product
3. Team
4. Execution

Outcome = Idea * Product * Team * Execution * (Luck * 1000)

1. Idea
Great execution is 10x more important than a great idea
Ideas do matter
size and growth of market, defensibility strategy etc.
long time planning is a worth exercise
some day you need to build a business thats difficult to replicate

The idea comes first, startup comes second

The company should feel like an important mission

Great startups seem like bad idea at the beginning - most people think it's bad - they won't steal it - but the idea is actually a good one

a market that is going to be big in 10 years - more important the current market size - small but rapidly growing markets - customers are keen to use an imperfect but rapidly improving product

You can change everything in the startup but the market

Why now? Why couldn't have been done years ago or in 2 years from now?

If it takes more than a sentence to explain what you're doing - it might be to complicated.

Think about customers and the market first

2. Product

Turn a great idea into a product and then into a company
Until you build a great product, nothing else matters
Sitting in front of computers and talk to customers
Eat, sleep, exercise and build a great product
Build something users love - talk to users

Better something that small numbers of users love that big amount of users like, cause its easier to expand

It's working when you get growth by word of mouth. Organic growth. Sales and marketing are important but only if you have a great product with initial organic growth.

Very few startups die from competition many startups die because they do something what the users don't love.

Great products win.

Simple is good, it forces you to do one thing extremely well.

Be fanatical about your product. Don't buy users in the early days. Recruit first users by hand.

Do things that don't scale - get users manually. Understand that group of users, listen to them and build for them. Then they will pay for it and help you get new users.

Build and engine to implement user feedback into your product and show it. Very tight feedback loop. It can be hours not days or weeks.

In the early days you gotta do sales and customer support yourself.

Focus on growth! Metrics:

Total registrations
Active users
Activity levels
Cohort retention
Revenue
Net Promoter Score

Ignore everything else until you get this right.

Lesson 2:

3. Team

A. Cofounders

Number one cause for death of startups are the co-founder
Better to have no co-founder than a bad co-founder
At least two founders (best you should know from college or company)
Target is 2 or 3 co-founders

You need someone that behaves like James Bond
Know your co-founders (also early hires)
Tough and calm co-founders (obviously smart)
Technical co-founders are a big advantage

B. Try not to hire
Paradox logic - It's better to have few employees than a lot
Stay small as long as you can, especially in the early days

AirBnB hired 2 people in the first year

"Would you take the job if you have one year to live?

C. Get the best people

Best people know, that they should join a rocket ship
Spent 0% or 25% on hiring not 50% (once you are in hiring mode)
Don't hire mediocre engineers (they can kill a startup)

Best source for hiring is people you already know (personal referrals)
Aptitude > Experience

Criteria:
Are they smart?
Do they get things done?
Do i want to spend a lot of time around them?

Good communication
Risk taking attitude (not choose between McKinsey and Startup)
Manically determined
Pass the animal test
Would feel comfortable reporting to them

Work on a quick project before hiring (2-3 days)
Call references and really dig in (is the person in the top 5%)

Equity: 10% for first 10 employees (4 years vesting)
Fight with investors not with employees

D. You've hired the best - keep them around

Don't tell them they're fucking up everyday
Give team credit for everything good, take the blame for yourself

Do 1 on 1 and give clear Feedback

E. Fire fast

It's better for both, when it doesn't work out
Also fire people who create office politics or who are persistently negative

Set equity split in the very beginning and it should be fairly equal
Example: 50%/50% with 4 years vesting

In the early days (communication and speed matters) don't work remote with your co-founders

4. Execution

Often the most critical part of starting a company
Whatever the founders do become the culture (lead by example)

Jobs of CEO:
A. Set the vision
B. Raise money
C. Evangelize
D. Hire and manage
E. Make sure the entire company executes
E.1. Can you figure out what do to?
E.2. Can you get it done?
Focus: two our three most important things, what to spend money, say no a lot, set overachieving goals, repeat goals, communicate, maintain growth and momentum, work together in person, weekly meeting, track KPI's, prevent distraction

Intensity: not best choice for work life balance, small amount of extra work on the right thing can make a big difference (viral coefficient example), Relentless operating rhythm, obsession with execution quality, bias towards action (quality + pace is key), not just for the product, quality everywhere in entire company, quick, do whatever it takes, show up, don't give up, be courageous

Best prediction for success: They've gotten new things done (knock down small chunks).

Show up in person, get on planes, do the things

Always keep momentum (don't take foot off the gas pedal) --> Always keep growing
Best growth engine is a great product from the beginning
Sales fix everything (get small wins if the bigger is not working out)

When there is disagreement ask your users and do what they think is right to do.

Set an operating rhythm:
Shipping product
Launch new features
Reviewing/reporting metrics and milestones (care about them!)

Don't worry about competitors at all unless they ship a better product.

Don't spend more money than you have.

Lesson 3:

Startup are counterintuitive (don't follow your instincts)
Pick people like you would pick people you would be friends with

What you need to know is not expertise in startups it's expertise about users
Mark Zuckerberg was a noob in startups but he knew about his users
The only task is to build something that someone wants

The notion of going through typical steps of a startup -> playing house
Figure out what the tricks are like you would do for an exam

The best way to convince investors is to bootstrap and grow
Starting a startup is where gaming the system stops to work

If you start a startup it will take over your life (opportunity cost)
It never gets easier, the nature of the problem changes

Enjoy life, travel don't start a startup to early
To come up with good ideas, turn your brain and think about problems first

1. Learn about things that matter
2. Work on problems that interest you
3. With people you like and respect

Real problems are interesting
Something really matters is domain expertise

Best advice: Just learn!

No business school because they're focused on management you need to design products. The best way to learn how to start a startup is just to start one you learn the fastest this way.

Side-projects are the best startups ideas

Lesson 5:

Business Strategy and Monopoly

There two types of business in the world the ones who are perfectly competitive and monopolies

People tell lies, monopolies will not tell that they own the market because of the threat being regulated by the governments whereas competitive companies will tell that they are in a narrow market.

Go after small markets that will be big in the future, don't dive into strongly competitive markets. They need to be so small that people almost don't even notice they exist.

It's easier to dominate a small market than a larger one

Business school analysis is bullshit because the market of Facebook would be to small (Only 10k student @ Harvard)

Appropriate technology
Network effects
Economies of scale
Branding

The next Marc Zuckerberg won't build a social network, so don't copy you don't learn from that.

All happy companies are different because they're doing something unique and the other way around.

Aim to be the last rather than the first. (Facebook is last SN, Microsoft is last OS etc.)

Growth rate is overrated. Durability and sustainability should be more important.

You must begin but studying the end game!

Complex vertically integrated coordinated intelligent systems to build a monopoly (economies of scale, low marginal costs, high adoption rate)

Fast adoption is critical to capture new markets

There is no wisdom in crowd, when a lot of people are doing something it's probably not a good idea to move into that direction

We're too focused on iterative models (Lean startup) rather than creating value

Lecture 6:

The single most important factor to growth is retention
You need the flattened curve to be parallel to the x-axis

Percent of users who have been active every single day (watch again)

Focus on having product market fit

Look if the first 100 people will be retained in the long run

Startups should not have growth team, the CEO should be the growth team

Every single startup should have one metric that matters (Sen messages for Whatsapp, MAU for FB)

Affiliate model: Active confirmed registered users instead of registered users

Magic moment that gets a user hooked (Facebook: See your friends)
