# Lecture 1

Sam Altman
build stuff and be around smart people, in best case people who are smarter than you
don't go for salary but for the things you love
only start something with what you're in love with
keep personal burn rate low

teach 30% thats applicate for building startups, 70% is hands on
goal is building a business where the goal is hypergrowth

It really is hard work like you would never imagine

The number 1 role of a CEO is managing his own psychology

Why starting a startup?
Specific passion should come first.

4 Areas
1. Idea
2. Product
3. Team
4. Execution

Outcome = Idea * Product * Team * Execution * (Luck * 1000)

1. Idea
Great execution is 10x more important than a great idea
Ideas do matter
size and growth of market, defensibility strategy etc.
long time planning is a worth exercise
some day you need to build a business thats difficult to replicate

The idea comes first, startup comes second

The company should feel like an important mission

Great startups seem like bad idea at the beginning - most people think it's bad - they won't steal it - but the idea is actually a good one

a market that is going to be big in 10 years - more important the current market size - small but rapidly growing markets - customers are keen to use an imperfect but rapidly improving product

You can change everything in the startup but the market

Why now? Why couldn't have been done years ago or in 2 years from now?

If it takes more than a sentence to explain what you're doing - it might be to complicated.

Think about customers and the market first

2. Product

Turn a great idea into a product and then into a company
Until you build a great product, nothing else matters
Sitting in front of computers and talk to customers
Eat, sleep, exercise and build a great product
Build something users love - talk to users

Better something that small numbers of users love that big amount of users like, cause its easier to expand

It's working when you get growth by word of mouth. Organic growth. Sales and marketing are important but only if you have a great product with initial organic growth.

Very few startups die from competition many startups die because they do something what the users don't love.

Great products win.

Simple is good, it forces you to do one thing extremely well.

Be fanatical about your product. Don't buy users in the early days. Recruit first users by hand.

Do things that don't scale - get users manually. Understand that group of users, listen to them and build for them. Then they will pay for it and help you get new users.

Build and engine to implement user feedback into your product and show it. Very tight feedback loop. It can be hours not days or weeks.

In the early days you gotta do sales and customer support yourself.

Focus on growth! Metrics:

Total registrations
Active users
Activity levels
Cohort retention
Revenue
Net Promoter Score

Ignore everything else until you get this right.

## Lecture 2

3. Team

A. Cofounders

Number one cause for death of startups are the co-founder
Better to have no co-founder than a bad co-founder
At least two founders (best you should know from college or company)
Target is 2 or 3 co-founders

You need someone that behaves like James Bond
Know your co-founders (also early hires)
Tough and calm co-founders (obviously smart)
Technical co-founders are a big advantage

B. Try not to hire
Paradox logic - It's better to have few employees than a lot
Stay small as long as you can, especially in the early days

AirBnB hired 2 people in the first year

"Would you take the job if you have one year to live?

C. Get the best people

Best people know, that they should join a rocket ship
Spent 0% or 25% on hiring not 50% (once you are in hiring mode)
Don't hire mediocre engineers (they can kill a startup)

Best source for hiring is people you already know (personal referrals)
Aptitude > Experience

Criteria:
Are they smart?
Do they get things done?
Do i want to spend a lot of time around them?

Good communication
Risk taking attitude (not choose between McKinsey and Startup)
Manically determined
Pass the animal test
Would feel comfortable reporting to them

Work on a quick project before hiring (2-3 days)
Call references and really dig in (is the person in the top 5%)

Equity: 10% for first 10 employees (4 years vesting)
Fight with investors not with employees

D. You've hired the best - keep them around

Don't tell them they're fucking up everyday
Give team credit for everything good, take the blame for yourself

Do 1 on 1 and give clear Feedback

E. Fire fast

It's better for both, when it doesn't work out
Also fire people who create office politics or who are persistently negative

Set equity split in the very beginning and it should be fairly equal
Example: 50%/50% with 4 years vesting

In the early days (communication and speed matters) don't work remote with your co-founders

4. Execution

Often the most critical part of starting a company
Whatever the founders do become the culture (lead by example)

Jobs of CEO:
A. Set the vision
B. Raise money
C. Evangelize
D. Hire and manage
E. Make sure the entire company executes
E.1. Can you figure out what do to?
E.2. Can you get it done?
Focus: two our three most important things, what to spend money, say no a lot, set overachieving goals, repeat goals, communicate, maintain growth and momentum, work together in person, weekly meeting, track KPI's, prevent distraction

Intensity: not best choice for work life balance, small amount of extra work on the right thing can make a big difference (viral coefficient example), Relentless operating rhythm, obsession with execution quality, bias towards action (quality + pace is key), not just for the product, quality everywhere in entire company, quick, do whatever it takes, show up, don't give up, be courageous

Best prediction for success: They've gotten new things done (knock down small chunks).

Show up in person, get on planes, do the things

Always keep momentum (don't take foot off the gas pedal) --> Always keep growing
Best growth engine is a great product from the beginning
Sales fix everything (get small wins if the bigger is not working out)

When there is disagreement ask your users and do what they think is right to do.

Set an operating rhythm:
Shipping product
Launch new features
Reviewing/reporting metrics and milestones (care about them!)

Don't worry about competitors at all unless they ship a better product.

Don't spend more money than you have.

## Lecture 3

Startup are counterintuitive (don't follow your instincts)
Pick people like you would pick people you would be friends with

What you need to know is not expertise in startups it's expertise about users
Mark Zuckerberg was a noob in startups but he knew about his users
The only task is to build something that someone wants

The notion of going through typical steps of a startup -> playing house
Figure out what the tricks are like you would do for an exam

The best way to convince investors is to bootstrap and grow
Starting a startup is where gaming the system stops to work

If you start a startup it will take over your life (opportunity cost)
It never gets easier, the nature of the problem changes

Enjoy life, travel don't start a startup to early
To come up with good ideas, turn your brain and think about problems first

1. Learn about things that matter
2. Work on problems that interest you
3. With people you like and respect

Real problems are interesting
Something really matters is domain expertise

Best advice: Just learn!

No business school because they're focused on management you need to design products. The best way to learn how to start a startup is just to start one you learn the fastest this way.

Side-projects are the best startups ideas

## Lecture 4

Only worry about generic use
Beware of frankenstein

### Ready for a lot of users

Learn one channel at a time
Creativity is key

Types of growth

e-mail, pr, bloggers

Customer feedback
support@ / phone
survey, interview
metrics / retention
ask why / better feedback when they pay for it


## Lecture 5

Business Strategy and Monopoly

There two types of business in the world the ones who are perfectly competitive and monopolies

People tell lies, monopolies will not tell that they own the market because of the threat being regulated by the governments whereas competitive companies will tell that they are in a narrow market.

Go after small markets that will be big in the future, don't dive into strongly competitive markets. They need to be so small that people almost don't even notice they exist.

It's easier to dominate a small market than a larger one

Business school analysis is bullshit because the market of Facebook would be to small (Only 10k student @ Harvard)

Appropriate technology
Network effects
Economies of scale
Branding

The next Marc Zuckerberg won't build a social network, so don't copy you don't learn from that.

All happy companies are different because they're doing something unique and the other way around.

Aim to be the last rather than the first. (Facebook is last SN, Microsoft is last OS etc.)

Growth rate is overrated. Durability and sustainability should be more important.

You must begin but studying the end game!

Complex vertically integrated coordinated intelligent systems to build a monopoly (economies of scale, low marginal costs, high adoption rate)

Fast adoption is critical to capture new markets

There is no wisdom in crowd, when a lot of people are doing something it's probably not a good idea to move into that direction

We're too focused on iterative models (Lean startup) rather than creating value

## Lecture 6

The single most important factor to growth is retention
You need the flattened curve to be parallel to the x-axis

Percent of users who have been active every single day (watch again)

Focus on having product market fit

Look if the first 100 people will be retained in the long run

Startups should not have growth team, the CEO should be the growth team

Every single startup should have one metric that matters (Sen messages for Whatsapp, MAU for FB)

Affiliate model: Active confirmed registered users instead of registered users

Magic moment that gets a user hooked (Facebook: See your friends)

Get users to feel love, joy and happiness

Don’t worry about users who use your product every day

What is the north start (that one metric)They are correlated anyway so it doesn’t matter

Have a north start and know the magic moment, think about the margin user don’t think about yourself

Tactics

Internationalize for growth

10 Friends in 14 days and focus on magic moment

Let the community translate or interact with whatever you’re trying to do

Prioritize the right languages (french, italian, german, spanisch)

Don’t build for what the world is today, build it for the future

Virality

A. Payload (How many people)
B. Frequency (Ho many times)
C. Conversion Rate (How many will convert)

Hotmail example (Sent from hotmail free)

Remove friction from the flow to optimize conversion

If you hit someone with the same creative over and over again they are less likely to click that creative

Import
Send
How many people
How many click
How many signup

Calculate k-factor (Get the factor over 1)

SEO

Keyword research is essential

What do people search for
How many people search for it
How many others ranking for it
How valuable is it

Google Adwords Keyword Planner tool is the best

Single most important thing is to get links from high authority websites

Do the basics (XML Sitemaps, Headers etc.)

E-Mail might be dead for people younger than 25

E-Mails, SMS and Push all behave the same way

Don’t push power users and annoy them, it’s hard to connect to them once they open out

Target newsletters don’t board cast

Example (I get a lot of likes and don’t want to be notified but for the first user it is the magic moment when he gets first like)

Trigger based notifications

A good plan violently executed today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow

Don’t be afraid to break stuff

Retention

All of your users are on your product after one day
No one would have been there after 365 days

All of your users who have been on your product one day, what percentage of them are monthly active

100% for the first 30 days

what percentage was monthly active after 31 days

# Lecture 7

Growth is the result of two variables (Conversion and Churn)
The get to a billion dollar company acquire that first dollar

Be fanatical about creating meaningful relationships with your users

First time interactions are crucial (Homepage, Landing pages, Plans, Pricing, Login, Signup etc.)
Other memorable things (First e-mail, account creation, starting interface, login link, ad link, first support)

Take it for granted quality and Enchanting quality

Put a smile on peoples faces - create emotions

Create a poem not just a form - create an experience

## Examples:
- Call to action "Get in there!"
- After trial expires we change font to comic sans ms
- hurl check http requests
- Mailchimp redesigned help pages so they look like magazine covers
- Automatically copy api keys to examples codes (stripe)
- Win a battle axe wufoo hackathon

There often is a disconnect between development and design and other areas (especially after launch)
Support Driven Development (SDD) - Make everyone do customer support
Creators = Supporters

Support responsible developers are the best supporters

Red phone at kayak (after the third call the developer fix it and the calls stop)

Response time 7-12 minutes for customer support

There is direct correlation of how much time we spent with users and how good the user experience is

Every six weeks for at least two hours direct exposure

There is a knowledge gap if you add new features you increase it

1% increase in conversion rate (new users) and 1% decrease in churn do exactly the same

Alter system check time since last login and show whats changed in the product

Handwritten thank you cards to users

## Market domincance
- Best price
- Best product
- Best overall solution

Focus on the people who are the most passionate
Number one focus is quality and make it as easy to use then polish
Make the smallest version of each single idea (one or two weeks)

King for a day (random person whas chosen, got ressources and could do what he thought is rigth) even if the choice is not right that made a difference in the app

# Lecture 8

Test hypothesis with a simple landing page and measure conversions (phone calls, e-mail etc.)

In the beginning just hack together solutions noone cares about a proper backend or scalable solutions

The mantra of do things that don't scale

Personalized e-mails to every single customer - get early customer feedback

1. Test your hypothesis
2. Launch fast
3. Do things that don't scale

## Finding your first users

There's no perfect solution for user acquisition

First users are impossible hard to get

Do whatever it takes to bring in your first customers

Don't focus on ROI, focus on growth

Don't give away your product for free (unsustainable strategy)

## Turning those users into champions

A champion is a user who talks about & advocates for your product

Handwritten cards, etc, something special

Deligh your user with experiences they will remember

Talk to you users!! (constantly, for as long as possible)

Run customer service as long as possible

Proacticely reach out to current & churned customers

Social media/communities

Problem are inevitable, do whatever it takes to make them right

## Findings product/market fit

The product you launch with will not be the product that finds market fit

Optimize for speed over scalability/clean code

Only worry about the next order of magnitude (from 0 to 1, from 1 to 10, from 10 to 100 etc.)

Stuff will break, you will make it work, you will survice just do it

Do things that don't scale as long as you possibly can

## PR

Press should have targeted audience and goals (Investors, Customers, Industry)

What is a story
* Product launches
* Funraising
* Milestones / metrics
* Business overview
* Stunts (crazy events)
* Hiring announcements
* Contributed articles

Think about your story objectively

You don't have to be original, just original enough

Mechanics of a story
1. Think of a story
2. Get introduced
3. Set a date (4-7 days in advance)
4. Reach out
5. Pitch
6. Follow up
7. Launch your news!

Have direct contact, phone call is better than e-mail

Draft the story in bullet points

Keep contacts fresh, stay in touch

Make schedule and calendar when to launch what (klout, buffer)

# Lecture 9

What makes you decide to invest in a company?

* Is this person a leader? You have to be a born leader.
* Is the person focused and obsessed.
* Is it based on a personal problem and experiecnce?
* How are the communication skills?

* VC Business is a game of extreme outliers
* Invest in strength vs. lack of weaness
* Have an extreme strength that makes you an outlier

* You gotta be able to say in one sentence what your business does
* You have to make be decisive and make decisions (procastination is devil)
* Decisions to hire decisions to fire
* Once you have a product it's all about execution and building a great team

* Make it simple and understandable (simple and clear)
* Pitch a business that don't need to raise money
* Bootstrap as long as you possibly can
* Be so good they can't ignore you
* You're always better of making your business better than making your pitch better
* Raising money is the easiest thing compared to recruiting, building a good product, growth etc.

What do you which founders to do differently?

* Single biggest thing most entrepreuners are missing is the relationship between risk and cash
* Make a list of risks (founding risks, product risks, launch risks, revenue risks, cost of sale risk, viral growth risk)
* Then peel away some of the risks (raise money to peel away first risks) and achieve milestones
* Calibrate the amount of the money you raise to the risks
* Don't ask people to sign for a NDA
* Do fundraising ASAP - hurry up and get it over
* E-Mail and confirm what just have been communicated (put everything in writing)
* In meetings take notes and follow-up

How does the process go?

* One investment per 30 companies they look at
* Leads from own network evaluate opportunities (due dilligence)
* Top tier investors only invest if seed round was raised before
* If the founder has been a sucessfull founder in the past, a straig Seria A can be raised (trust)

What terms should founder care most about, how should they negotiate?

* Pick the right seed investors
* Get introduced (good introductions matter a lot)

What should the valuation be?

* Threshhold for seed seems to be below 10 million
* Don't raise more than you need

How much equity should founders give away?

* Seed, 10% - 15%
* Series A, you should sell 20% - 30%
* Check dilution (you end up with 5% after multiple rounds)

Most succesful investment ever made?

* Investment in Google (Intro by Stanford Prof.)
* Investmehr at AirBnb (Growth Round)

When you start a company, find someone as good or better than you. Chances of success will grow astronomically

Mark Zuckerberg is an outlier

Operational excellence matters a lot

Working with your Co-Founders should be considered a marriage (Investment for life)

The biggest constraint is the concept of opportunity costs, it's not about loosing the money but an investment rules out conflicts (one investment per category - lockout/conflict policy) and requires time and effort

MVP doesn't make sense for a SaaS product, then a straight A round can be raised

# Lecture 10

## What is company culture?

Everyday core values and actions of each member of the team in pursuit of our company mission.

"Your beliefs become your thoughts. Your thought become your words. Your words become your actions. Your actions become your habits. Your habits become your values. Your values become your destiny."

## Why does it matter?

- First principles
- Alignment
- Stability
- Trust
- Exclusion
- Retention

## Core value worksheet

1. As the leader, what personal values are most important to you?
2. What are the most important values for business success?
3. What values will you look for in employees?
4. What could never be tolerated?
5. Remember to incorporate your mission into your core value

## Elements of high performing teams

Trust -> Conflict -> Commitment -> Accountability -> Results

## Best practises for culture

1. Incorporate your mission to your values
2. Performance = think harder, deeper, longer about values
3. Interview for culture fit
4. Evaluate performance on culture as well
5. Make it a daily habit

At some point you shift from building the product to building the company that builds the product.

If you can't build a great company your product will not endure.

There have to be unique values if you would only want to tell 3 or 4 things, what would it be?

Hire people that come for a mission (not for office design, valuation etc.) not just for a job

Founding DNA become the principles later

Constantly hire someone better and smarter than you and keep evolving

Culture are the vlaues in the inside and brand is the promise on the outside

There is no good or bad but strong or weak culture

Articulate vision over and over again

# Lecture 11

### What the core pieces of culture?

1. Who do you hire?
2. What do you do everyday?
3. What do you communicate?
4. What to choose to celebrate/punish?

Internal trancparency and to use the right tools

### What do you look for when hire the initial employees (first 10)?

Look for people you want to work with and who are smart

Look for people who work hard and are creative

People who are excited about many disciplines and extraordanary in one

Want to build something great and take the risk

The first ten people will have an immense influence

### What have you done to make the first people happy and effective?
 
Get them up and running and make them do real world

# Lecture 12

Building for the Enterprise

## How to get here?

* In 2004 it was really hard to share files
* Cost of storage was dropping
* More powerful browser and networks
* More locations and people to share with

Always look for changing environment / technology factors

* Over-developed for consumers and under-developed for enterprises
* Consumer space is fun but how to you monetize (payed vs. ads) - B2C
* There is a bigger market and revenue in the enterprise space (3.7 trillion USD) - B2B
* No love and care for user design and experience in enterprise products

Everything in Enterprise has changed

* On-premise computing moves to cloud
* Expensive computing becomes cheap
* Customized software is standardized
* Large enterprises before, now every business
* Regional before now global
* IT-Led before now user-led

Decades of infrastructure is now moving to the cloud in enterprises

Open platforms are more asked  that customizations

IT model of enterprise shifts to user, selling comes laters

Nearly 2 billions smart phones in the planet

Nearly 3 billion people online

Every industry is going through a technology and business model disruption right now

* Retail
* Healthcare
* M&E
* Education
* Advertisting
* Hi-Tech
* Construction
* Package Goods
* Energy
* Government
* Legal
* Manufacturing

They need technology from startups to get through this

Steps

1. Identify underlying technology changes that the company will face in a couple of years
2. There is going to be software that serves those needs

Every company in the world needs better technology to work smarter, faster and more securely

## How to you get started?

### Spot disruptions

Look for new enabling technologies that create a wide gap between how things have been and how they can be done

### Intentionally start small

Start with something simple and small then expand over time. If people call it a "toy" you're definitely onto something.

Identify the gaps in the full solutions

### Find asymmetries

Do things than incuments can't or won't do because it's economically or technically infeasible.

### Find the almost crazy outliers

Go after the customers that are working in the future, but that haven't totally lost their minds.

Ask what is missing in the future or a future scenarios?

### Listen to customers

But don't always build exactly what they want. Build what they need.

### Modularize don't customize

Every customer will want something a little bit different. Don't make the product suffer for this. (Salesforce)

Think about Openness and API's.

### Focus on the user

Keep "consumer" DNA at the core of your enterprise product. This will always pay dividends.

### Your product should sell itself

Sales should be used to navigate customers and close deals, not be a substitute for a great product.

# Lecture 13

### Skills that are important

* Delegation
* Location
* Vision
* Focus
* Flexibility
* Evaluation
* Confidence
* Risk
* Data
* Persistence
* Going Public
* Communication
* Operations
* Business Strategy
* Execution
* Pivoting
* Product
* Growth Hacking
* Design
* Competition
* Recruiting
* Financing
* Legal
* Equity
* Scaling
* Marketing
* Idea
* Founding Team

It's better to have 2 or 3 people in the team so you can compensate missing skills

High trust between founders is very important

Where is the strongest network for the particular problem i'm trying to solve

You dont want so start a sales or fashion company in silicon valley

What do you as a founder know what other people don't know that acually plays out to be true

Data only exists within a framework of a vision you are building to

You need to take risks and on the same hand minimize risks

How does the feedback you get from smart people change your confidence level?

There is not one skillset but rather have vision thats driving you and then create a network around it

Don't try to boil the ocean or go after a swiss knife approach but really focus especially in the beginning

# Lecture 14 - How to operate

Building a company is like building an engine, you are first architecting on a whiteboard but the reality is hard

Focus on increasing the output not the input

It should feel like a mess and chaotic (new problems everyday) otherwise you're innovating to slow

The most important part is to clarify and simplify and omit things

Don't accept excuses that things are to complicated

Optimize process so you're omitting less every month

Have a consistent voice everywhere, everything should feel the same

Instruct more if the employee is unexperiened, let them free if they have experience

You don't get more done by hiring, sometimes even less

Keep expanding responsibility until it breaks, leave it there

**Insist on focus** - There should only be one thing / problem you should talk about

Prioritize (1, 3, 5 rule)

Build a simple dashboard (drafted by founder, metrics for success, showing key value preposition)

How many employees are using you're dashboard every day?

Be transparent, show everything, talk about everything

Show and review board slides with everyone in the company

Transparent compensation works in sports why shouldn't it in business?

Details matter, the whole piece of work makes the overall result (start with the food people eat)

# Lecture 15

## One Management Concept

When making a critical decision, you must understand how it will be interpreted from each persons point of view and its ompact on the union of the individual views.

You have to be formal to save your own culture

There has to be a process for a salaray instead even if the employee has done a great job

Don't do things offcycle or just because you asked so you have to be really aggressive

**Perspectives***

- You
- Employee
- Everyone else (culture)

SV companies dilute 6-8% per year when they are private for employee comp

1. Treat employees with the utmost straight-forwardness and fairness and give 10 years exercise for stocks
2. Tell up front what guarantees they have in terms of salary and stock options

It's not your perspective or the perspective of the person that you are talking to at the moment that matters. You must consider the people who are not in the room.

They are the company.

They are the culture.

# Lecture 16 - How to Run a User Interview

Talk to the different types of users (especially if you're building a multi-sided platform)

## Example for note taking app

1. Who would you go ask for feedback? And do you find them? (write it down)

- target college students
- different types of students (schools, types)
- college it / administrators (they spend money)
- parents / other responsible people
- digg into details and listen to potential users
- users think they know what they need

2. If you could build just one feature on top of google docs, what would they be?

Focus on just one-thing that makes it a little better than google docs

- Collaborative aspects of google docs but designed more around note taking

Validate that idea further becomes you actually build it

# Lecture 17 - How to design hardware products

Internet of things is happening right now

You have to be great at everything

- Hardware
- Software & Services
- Data

etc.

Everything is a system and connected, don't look at it in silos

### Process

- Exploration
- Early Validation
- Concept
- Planning
- Development
- Continued Innovation

**Exploration**

Unbridled Imagination

- Vision
- Brand
- Strategy

Futuristic design of what the world is going to look like in the future

**Early Validation**

Proving your thesis like a Ph.D.

- Exploring the system
- Outling a story

**Concept**

Big, human-centric concepts

- Starting on a journey
- Excitement about whats possible
- Asking big questons
- Selling the experience

**Planning**

Emerge of a product

- No turning back
- Building belief
- Trade-off conversations and creative problem solving

**Development**

Bringing it to life

- Anchoring the relay
- Having a shared understanding of what, why & how

Initial launch

**Continued Innovation**

Feeding the fire

- Going from imagination to execution on specific challenges
- Creating dialogue with the world

### The Framework

- Whys (a clear and memorable articulation of the humand and business problem we are solving)
- Themes (Experience-based story tracks that translates "whys" into actionable concepts)
- Pods (Cross-functional teams empowered to explore, act on and ultimately own a theme)
- Hero/Sidekick experience (scenarios that evaluate concepts to signature solution)
- Features (building blocks of the core object of experience)

### User experience process

1. Research (Whys - a list of customer problems to solve)
2. Inisght (Principles - approach to solving problems)
3. Conept (Hows - proposed solutions to the problem presented as experience scenarios)
4. Design & Build (What - Requirements that have to be included in the product)

### Example

**Whys of Up24**

1. Real-time feedback helps me stay on track and achieve my goals today, rather than try to do better tomorrow
2. I need to understand my data in a more meaningful, relevant and timely context that makes the "so what" obvious
3. I need guidance, including structured and motivating activities to keep me going
4. I want ongoing encouragement and in-the-moment validation that i'm on the right track and doing well
5. I want a more fluid and frictionless way to manually log activities and never want to "miss" a sleep

### Behavioural Loop

1. Track (Create habit of logging)
2. Understand (Reflect learning about what you track)
3. Act (Combine everything to trigger action as early as possible)

# Lecture 18 - Legal & Accounting

### Entity

- Delaware corporation
- Keep it simple

### Organization

- Future due diligence requirements
- Humdrum reality of running a startup

### Equity

- Execution > Idea
- How much equity for each founder?
- Look forward, not backwards

Don't overinflate prior experience, education or who came up with the idea.
