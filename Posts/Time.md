(What you’ll learn under the first picture)

Spend more time on the things that matter and stop wasting time on unimportant tasks. This posts put a lot of emphasis on the time that other studies often times just summarize as work related topics and is an attempt to break down my own time more than anything else. Theres been some people who appreciated my advise and hope it’ll help you too.

(Motivation)

Two months ago my wife told me that I'll become a second time father. The first experience was already incredible, intense and changed my live forever. And now a second, wow! Yeah. Man. Sleepless nights, changing diapers ah its gonna be nice. But wait, my wife and I usually were a good team rotating with the first kid and now theres gonna be two? Especially after the responsibilities in my life became bigger, I felt like I needed a new way to organize my life.

One aspect that changed the most is the allocation of my time. Parents will know - We spend a major amount of time with my family and we want to. And yet, its not only parents. We order our goods online to save time, we order an Uber to save time, we were headphones so people don’t approach us to save time, you know what I’m talking about.

I believe time is biggest asset or our era.

## We are procrastination monkeys
Do you know your procrastination monkey? Well, I’m best bros with mine. He forces me to do things like read random stories about all the wars in history on wikipedia or watch slow motion videos of people throwing liquids in each others faces. Watch this videos if you don’t know what I’m talking about.

I’m not sure if thats a millennial thing but things like productivity and being very efficient has been always very important to me. So why am I finding myself reading the entire literate on things like the postwar period in Europe since 1945. Yes thats interesting but I went to my computer to write documentation for my software or create a new marketing plan for Q2, damn.

The biggest problem however is that I don’t always have deadlines. I once heard a project always take the amount of time it has given. Even though I’ve been very critical about arbitrary deadlines, today I’d say they work. The reason why I think it works is not because we are forced to trade time for quality or money, its more that time constraints make us procrastinate less and actually do the work. 

> Because we know otherwise the panic monster will find us.

I started a company two years ago called Tapglue which recently has been acquired. We wanted to work a lot and achieve great things. Its been very challenging to balance everything and clearly I needed to change how I was utilizing my time, so I did what I also do: Developed a framework: Introducing the time utilization framework.

## The time utilization framework
I started researching on how I was spending time and a snowball effect happened. For some reason I started googling what other people spend their time on, so I’m more biased when thinking about mine. I moved from one article to another had, 36 tabs open started to take a lot of notes. You know you’re having to many tabs open when you can’t see the fav icons anymore and your browser looks somewhat like this:

[Image of Chrome with 100 tabs here]

I also grew never ending lists and notes with Evernote, Google keep, Github and most recently, Bear.

Afterwards I did the only logical thing I started to think about allocation of time and analyzed my work using proper tools. I used rescuetime and I believe there are multiple others that do the job.

The results where shocking.

Most interestingly I spend 30% of my day researching, 10% creating something and 8% on entertainment like Facebook, Youtube etc. I like researching and I believe I’m good at it. But it doesn’t create any value for anybody else but me. Also if you’re like me FOMO comes into play. The fear of missing out some essential information during your the research so you just keep going.

> What if didn’t find the killer article yet?

I started installing a bunch of time tracking tools such as Rescue time and other to track what I’m actually spending time on. Next I took some time to go through old todo lists and categories the tasks that I’ve been spending time on. Last I started to do something that I haven’t done for a long time: Disconnect and just think. The result looks as follow:

### Define your personal goals

So after analyzing my work behavior I started thinking about what I actually want to achieve during my time. Generally I want to spend time on things that matter most and use my time more efficiently, but what exactly? I thought about the top 4 things that I want to do with my time.

**Spend time with my family**
Becoming a father changed a lot in this regard. I don’t want to end up regretting not having spend enough time with my family.

This post focuses on how to spend time during work and yet it is a natural consequence to me to spend more time with my family as I’m going to spend less wasting time at work.

**Spend more time creating**
I love to be productive and get things done. I’m addicted checking things off my list. But I often work on research tasks or reactive communication with people rather than creating. By creating I mean working on a product that other people can use, wether that is art, software or something to eat.

**Spend more time thinking**
When was the last time you were thinking about something without a smartphone or any other distraction. I mean just letting your thought flow. Mine was a long time ago, and figured when I was flying to Boston and son slept on my legs. I couldn’t reach my phone or anything else to read and I didn’t want to wake him up. I fact the whole plane was sleeping so I just thought about random things. I have to admit it was pretty hard initially, the first 10-15 minutes were very strange but that something interesting happened. My brain started to jump from one thought to another I had all those ideas in my head of what I could do next. I wanted to write all those things down but couldn’t so I kept thinking. The longer I thought the crazier and more awesome the ideas became. In my case it was a lot about where SaaS Software and Software development in general is going, you know what I’m talking about.

A short while after my son woke up, I took my smartphone and started typing everything I could remember. You know writing with your Slackbot or another way to take notes :)

Why do I tell you this?
To me it was amazing how much we just ignore the power of plain distraction free thinking. I believe its one of the most important sources for innovation.

**Increase amount of productive sessions**
Do you know those days where you get almost the same amount done as in an entire week. My goal is to increase those moments while cutting down the overall time spent at work. I sincerely believe thats it is possible and I don’t want to wait any longer to experiment myself.

There is a lot of science going on in this field and I want to point out that I didn’t use any scientific methods to generate the framework, its merely based on my experience so take it with a grain of salt.

[Image overview of categories and their goals]

### Thinking

Goals:
- Generating innovative ideas
* Stimulate brain

If you’re like me, there is barely any moment in your life when you’re bored or have nothing to do. Even if you’re commuting somewhere you’re either checking mails or listening to a podcast about how to save 20 minutes per day with yxz (better example). When was the last time you’ve been disconnected from the internet, had no smartphone and actually started to think about a topic? I couldn’t remember and it was a shocking moment.

So I scheduled a slot and wanted to think for 30 minutes What was even more shocking is that I had an extremely hard time to sit still and think without being online or checking my phone. After 10 minutes literally forcing myself to think interesting things happened. I started to connect different thoughts and new ideas came to my mind. (better example)

Thinking is an essential task that I recommend everyone to do. Thinking is something that truly creates value and results in innovative ideas.

There are some examples where we actually do think. An example is a workshop. A google design sprint is the perfect example to setup a structure that requires the participants to actually think.

### Researching & Education

Goals:
- Information gathering
* Learning something

This is the most educational activity of all. Studying a certain topic, reading a book or article, watching a tutorial, guide or whatever.
I ranted a lot on researching and that it would take up 80% of my time and yet it will still remain an important and essential part of my daily work.

Whenever I have to learn something new like a programming language, a marketing strategy, the solution to a program in general I go ahead and google. These days I not only google I find myself trying directly to Youtube, Quora, Medium, or even Github for technical problems.

This activity consist of either reading, listening or watching to information I believe are useful to solve the problem I’m experiencing.

### Communication

Goals:
- Sustaining information symmetry with peers
* Coordinating certain tasks and events

This category highly depends on your job. There are jobs that exist only because of communication and that is perfectly fine and should be planned accordingly. In my case, I’d like to cut communication to a minimum both on the internal and external level. Over-communication can be benefits however I figured that information dilute when there is to much noise, so I’d rather communicate when needed with more focus.

Typical activities today are meetings, emails, calls, video conferences, messengers such as slack.

I could write a whole blog post about how work and expect to work here when it comes to the different communication channels and wether they’re synchronize or synchronize. E-Mail my friends is asynchronous communication so it should be okay to answer within a couple of hours to a day.  When you need something right away, walk to a person or just call.

### Preparing

Goals:
- Increase quality of your work
* Validate your assumptions

This a strange one as it can include multiple of the other categories. It could be that you prepare by creating something or regenerating etc. but I didn’t want to get to scientific about the consistency of the categorization and just label the categories rather than coming up with mutually exclusive, commonly exhaustive ones.

- Installing a software or setting up an environment to me is preparing
* Practicing a speech is preparing
* Defining the structure for a meeting is preparing

This category could also be framed as just: work. As you can’t categorize all the different types of activities people to prepare.

The last one is a big one. I’ve seen people beginning to think just after the meeting started. Thats bad, and here is why:

In the meeting your sitting with multiple people. If you don’t prepare you’re automatically stealing their valuable time. Time is the most important topic right, so please prepare. Its ok to gather and think about a certain problem but that should be framed as a Workshop and still prepared. Read how to do a google design sprint, silent brainstorming or whatever and prepare. A workshop btw. Would fall into the category thinking as mentioned above.

### Performing

Goals:
- Bring your work to life
* Get feedback

Yes perform! When all the research, preparation and creation is done. We can perform. To me thats the reward of all the previous work. Even if its just deploying a piece of software and it just works, it feels very rewarding.

I can only imagine how it must feel to an entertainer of getting standing ovations for a good performance. Computers don’t to that yet when running my software.

### Creating

Goals:
- Creating a product or service
* Creating information that are sustainable

Alright friends lets get to the meat. Enough with the bullshit. If you’re like me you want to get your hands dirty.

Often times VCs want to invest in companies that be scaled through marketing rather than sales? Why is that. When you do smart marketing you create assets, wether thats content or campaigns. Most of that can be repackaged, automated and thus scaled. Its hard to scale a sales call or meeting, that falls into either communication or performing I believe.

Typical tasks than involve creating something in my case are: 

- Writing
- Programming
- Designing
* Filming

We live in a strange era where you can outsource the creation of certain things by just preparing and communicating. Even though preparing most likely contains some creation here is an example:

- You have an app idea (thinking)
* You write specification (preparation + creation)
* You search an agency (researching)
* You write them and have a few meetings (communication)
* You test the software (performing)

### Transportation

Goals:
- Arriving at a desired destination
* Meeting people

We travel a lot. Our ancestors took years to conquer the planet so its probably in our genes. Lets take a simple example. Often times I underestimated the impact of daily commutes throughout my day. If you travel 30 minutes to work every day. Assuming 250 workdays thats 125 hours. There are so many things you can do in 125 hours I don’t even want to go there.

So what, we just stop commuting? Yes, thank you (hihihihi). This year I changed a significant amount of my work to a remote setup where I can either work from home or a co-working space near home. My average commute is now 10 minutes throughout the week, so I gained 41 hours to write annoying blog posts like this one.

Also, lets take a step back. Transportation is a great opportunity to listen to music or even a podcast and ideally just enjoy the people and nature around you and think.

### Regenerating

Goals:
- Gain energy
* Be enabled to perform every other activity

We’re no robots (or are we?), so we need to regenerate. The most obvious one is sleep. And since we live in great times there are many alternatives to regenerate. A lot thinks happen while we sleep I’m not even close of having enough knowledge to give you sufficient advice. Just make sure you’re having the right amount of time of good quality sleep. For me that means no electronics in the bedroom and no heavy food before going to bed. Find out what works for you.

To meditate is another great example. We are training our bodies and not so much our brains, why is that? The good news is that it changes. I’m sure you know at least 1 person who meditates.

Similar activities are Yoga although I’m not sure wether that falls into the category of exercising or regenerating.

And then there is eating. Well I admit I’ve seen people where eating would better fall into the category of performing and others where it would be leisure and yet to me is an essential activity to fill-up nutrients in your body. Yes its more than that there thousands year of culture and yet, when we would be starving we it boils down to that single essential task.

This btw. Is the category we spend most time, which is no surprise as everybody should sleep a sufficient amount of time.

### Exercising

- Improve physical health
* One more fucking goal that I can’t think of

Humans have muscles, and they need to contract to do certain tasks. The better trained you are the easier certain tasks in life become. Seriously many people underestimate the impact of a strong physical health. I’ve learned the reverse way. I was in good shape until my late twenties and then I decided to become father and start a company at the first time. Well guess what category I spend no time anymore over night. Exactly researching… Not.

To me following activities:

- Sports & Fitness
- Walking
- Cycling

The list goes on, find what works best for you.

### Leisure

Goals:
- Enjoy life
* Don’t regret

I left the best for the last. Socializing, relaxing and leisure.
Spending time with the people you love on any activity.

Jeff Bezos talks about the regret minimization matrix in this famous video, so when project myself in 60 years and look back. This is the category I probably which I would have spend a significant time in. What we’re doing however is different. We’re spending time on everything else and have a good time in the time that is left. Well I think we have to reverse that. I’m not a huge fan of romanticism or being spontaneous so I started to plan my leisure time. Even though it was strange in the beginning to have calendar entry that says Quality time with family, or Early dinner or something similar. It works. And thats the most important lesson to me.

I’m not all in the position to tell you what leisure is, but I’m sure you know. What did you love to do as a kid? When was the last time you smiled deep from your heart? Answer the questions and you’ll find out.

Oh and btw. there was a time where playing video games easily accounted for 80% of my time spent. Good that I have a father who knows how to pull the plug :)

### Others

There are many other activities that would very well deserve an own category.

First of this is no holistic view on the topics. As you’ve probably noticed I left out many activities such as traveling, purchasing, caring, household activities	 and even others. This posts reflects my status quo which doesn’t include a lot of travel, purchasing or other activities not listed here. I count caring as leisure as thats what it is to me when I can care for the people I love.

I don’t know what I don’t know and I’m sure there a dozen categories that I didn’t even think of.

This is more a personal opinion rather than a proper conducted study, so please take it with a grain of salt.

### Build your own schedule

Remember the schedules when you were at school, where every subject was planned to the minute. Thats exactly how I wanted to apply the allocation of the different categories to my daily life.

Here is a plan, that I thought will work for me:

05h - Thinking (3%)
17h - Researching (10%)
05h - Communicate (3%)
12h - Prepare (7%)
03h - Perform (2%)
22h - Create (13%)
02h - Transport (1%)
55h - Regenerate (32%)
09h - Exercise (5%)
34h - Leisure (25%)
04h - Others (2%)

Knowing what I’m spending my time on allowed me to think about how I actually want to spend it. It made me actively change my schedule such as:

1. I actively introduced time blocks for thinking.
2. Spend more quality time with my family
3. I didn’t want to spend more time communicating than 1h per day.
4. I wanted to allocate more time actually creating something.
5. I removed transportation overhead to a minimum.
6. I increases exercise and leisure time (Weekends are family time).

Last, lets take a typical day in my calendar.

[Image of Calendar]

Sounds like I figured it all out, right? Alright I admit I prepared this screenshot just for that post and in reality it looks similar. Does every day and week look like this? I wish, there is a lot of variance especially in the beginning when I implemented this system. I prepared my first week for 2 hours on a Sunday evening and almost nothing went as planned. My goal is to learn over time which might include to adjust the plan.

### I’m getting more done, you can too

One month in and I’m gonna be honest with you. I still wasn’t able to implement this method to a 100% but I’m close. I regularly take time to think (2h per week) and started excising more often.

I can also plan much better. When I want to do an online-course I look at my time allocated for research & education and make time for it. It means I either read less, or make time from another category. Even if you don’t actually have to do something my awareness of what I actually want to spend my time doing, totally changed.

I’m much more focused when I start a task because I know my time is limited. I cut off meetings whenever they can easily replaced with an email or a quick call. And overall I’m just more balanced and don’t have the feeling that I could more anymore.

(Conclusion)

Now that I found a semi scientific way to break down my time what did I win? Whats even the whole point of this?

Time is limited and I want to make the most out of it. This framework helped me to prioritize spending more time on the important tasks and less on unimportant ones.

The next step is to take action, clear your calendar and say no to meeting. Or allocate those 2 hours to read something or event think. If you don’t plan accordingly you’ll most likely not do it.

So if you think you should think more, do it. Think about what activity falls into thinking (boom, so meta) and just do it.

Disclaimer: This is no idea of my own and I find it so eye opening that I have to use it here:

[Add image of time left]

Time is the single most important asset of our time. Everything that saves time will be used and everything that costs time is annoying.

### So what? Evaluate your time today.

Decide where you want to spend your time and more importantly where not to spend it.

Allocate your time strategically. Often times we go for instant gratification but you should think long term and allocate your time to the things that are really important. You’re the only person who can tell what that is.

Please let me know what you think and how you manage your time. Any feedback on this article is welcome.

You made it to the I can’t believe it. You deserve a pro-tip that I just recently discovered: Swim and think. Its the perfect combination as you can’t escape and just focus on your swim and think about anything. The swimming part becomes an automatism very soon so you can focus all your energy on thinking.

How was your experience with time? I’d love to hear what you think.

Oh btw, I also tweet(link) things.
