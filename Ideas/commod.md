Implications of commoditizations

## History is good indicator for impact & consequences

- increase efficiency and effectiveness

## Changing factor

- AI & ML
- Access to data and intelligence

## Before

- differentiating features that allow for premium pricing
- high profit margins

## After

- active mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deal flows
- market leaders will have lower costs

## Risks

- Competitors enter market
- Price deflation
 you can only compete based on costs
 - low profit margins
 - cost reductions to stay efficient

## Opportunities

- Build brand
- Innovate: Differentiation needed --> innovation & quality
- Bundle: Sell bundles, after sales services etc.
- Segment: Focus on a specific market segment, focus on less sensitive customer segments for who product is important.
- Customer relationship management

## Customer

- Increased access
- Lower price

## Conclusion

- Everything will be commoditized and the big one (AWS, GCP, Microsoft) will own it, eventually.

- Google started publishing papers where Hadoop, HDFS, HBase was intended. Now they're just releasing Tensorflow.
